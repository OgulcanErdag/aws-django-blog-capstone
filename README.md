The Blog Page Application is a Django-based web application deployed on AWS. It uses an Application Load Balancer with an Auto Scaling EC2 group, an RDS database within a VPC, and Amazon S3 for storing user-uploaded images and videos. Amazon CloudFront and Route 53 are used to manage and secure incoming traffic.
